		<p><span class="lead">In seventh grade, my Neopets obsession</span> inspired me to dabble in web design and development, and I've been fiddling with pixels ever since. I like quantifying things and finding the perfect verbal articulation of an idea. I also enjoy bubble tea, Markdown, and infecting other people with a love for design and typography.</p>
		<p>I'm interested in software product and interaction design, but I really love (and secretly indulge in) print and editorial design. My goals for the future include: designing a typeface (a humanist sans serif with a whimsical italic), actually posting something to dribbble, completing NaNoWriMo for the <em>fifth</em> time, and designing things that positively impact people's lives.</p>
